# Dataset Configuration for YOLO Training
# ==========================================
# This file tells YOLO where to find your images and labels
# 
# Path structure:
# - All paths are relative to this file's location
# - Images go in: data/training/images/, data/validation/images/, etc.
# - Labels go in: data/training/labels/, data/validation/labels/, etc.
# - Image and label files must have matching names (except extension)

# Root directory of your dataset
# Change this if your data folder is in a different location
path: ./data

# Training images (relative to 'path')
# YOLO will look for images here
train: training/images

# Validation images (relative to 'path')
# YOLO uses these to check how well the model is learning
val: validation/images

# Test images (optional, relative to 'path')
# Used for final evaluation after training
test: test/images

# Number of classes
# Currently: 1 class (robot)
# Future: Add more classes (gantry, tracks, etc.)
nc: 1

# Class names
# Maps class ID to class name
# Class 0 = robot
# Future: Add more classes
#   1: gantry
#   2: robot_on_track
names:
  0: robot

# How to use this file:
# ============================================================================
# 1. Place this file in your project root (same folder as train_robot_model.py)
# 2. Make sure your directory structure matches:
#    data/
#    ├── training/
#    │   ├── images/  (PNG files)
#    │   └── labels/ (TXT files)
#    ├── validation/
#    │   ├── images/
#    │   └── labels/
#    └── test/
#        ├── images/
#        └── labels/
# 3. Run: python train_robot_model.py
